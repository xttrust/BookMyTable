## Design

  

### Goal

  

The design of **BookMyTable** aims to provide a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface that enhances the user experience for both diners and restaurant staff. By utilizing the default Bootstrap 5 theme, we ensure a responsive and consistent look across different devices and screen sizes. This choice simplifies the design process while maintaining a professional appearance.

  

### Colour Scheme

  

The default Bootstrap 5 color scheme has been selected for **BookMyTable**. These colors are carefully chosen to provide a balanced and visually appealing aesthetic that suits a wide range of applications. The Bootstrap 5 palette ensures excellent readability and accessibility, which is essential for a diverse user base. The familiar and neutral tones help create a welcoming and easy-to-navigate environment for users. You can view the default Bootstrap colors [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/color/).

## Models

### User Model

The User model is a fundamental component of Django's authentication system, providing essential fields for user management such as username, email, and password. It facilitates user authentication and authorization, serving as the backbone for user interactions within the application. The default User model is extended via the admin interface to include additional functionalities specific to the application's needs.

### Reservation Model

The Reservation model manages the booking details for tables within the restaurant. It includes fields such as the user who made the reservation, the date and time of the reservation, the number of guests. This model is crucial for handling the core functionality of table reservations, ensuring smooth booking and management processes.

### MenuItem Model

The MenuItem model represents individual dishes or drinks available at the restaurant. It includes fields for the item name, description, price, and category (e.g., appetizer, main course, dessert). This model allows for efficient management and updating of the restaurant's menu offerings, ensuring diners have access to the latest menu items.

### MenuCategory Model

The MenuCategory model organizes menu items into categories, making it easier for users to browse through the restaurant's offerings. It includes fields for the category name and a description. This hierarchical structure enhances the user experience by providing a clear and organized menu layout.

### Notification Model

The Notification model manages system notifications for various user actions such as login, logout, registration, and reservation updates. It includes fields for the notification type, message content, and the user to whom the notification is sent. This model ensures users are kept informed of important events and actions related to their account and reservations.

### Agile Methodology

In my project, **BookMyTable**, I use Agile methodology to help manage the development process effectively. Here’s how it works:

1. **Work in Short Cycles (Sprints)**
   - I break the project into small, manageable chunks called sprints, each lasting about two days to one week. At the end of each sprint, I review what has been accomplished and plan the next steps.

2. **Define What to Build (User Stories)**
   - I write user stories to describe what features or improvements are needed. Each story outlines what needs to be done from the user’s perspective, making it clear what the goal is.

3. **Daily Check-ins**
   - I do quick daily updates to keep track of progress, identify any problems, and stay focused on the goals for the current sprint.

4. **Plan the Sprint**
   - At the start of each sprint, I plan which user stories or tasks I will work on. This helps me set clear goals and manage my time effectively.

5. **Review and Get Feedback**
   - At the end of each sprint, I review the work done and gather feedback. This helps me ensure the project is on the right track and meets the desired goals.

6. **Reflect and Improve**
   - After each sprint, I take time to reflect on what went well and what could be improved. This helps me make better decisions and improve my process for the next sprint.

7. **Stay Flexible**
   - I remain open to changes and adapt my plans as needed based on feedback or new insights. This flexibility helps me respond to any changes or challenges that arise.

By using Agile, I manage the project in a way that allows for regular progress checks, continuous improvement, and adjustments based on feedback. This approach helps me stay organized and focused while adapting to new information and ensuring the project evolves effectively.

#### GitHub Projects/Board

The project adopted a basic Board structure, which was divided into columns such as Todo, In Progress, and Done. This setup provided a clear and organized way to track the progress of tasks, making it easier to visualize and manage the workflow throughout the development process. The GitHub project Board was linked to the repo for consistent reference.

    <details><summary>Contact Success Message</summary>
    <img src="./docs/images/features/contact-success-message.png" alt="Contact Success Message">
    </details>

- **Failure Message**: If the form submission fails due to validation errors or server issues, users will see an error message indicating what went wrong. This ensures that users are aware of the issue and can correct their input.

#### Django Handling

- **Form Processing**: In Django, form submissions are handled in the view function associated with the contact form. Upon submission, the form data is processed and validated.

    - **On Success**: If the form data is valid, Django typically redirects the user to a success page or displays a success message on the same page using Django's messages framework.

    - **On Failure**: If the form data is invalid (e.g., missing required fields, incorrect email format), Django will re-render the form with error messages for each invalid field. The user is prompted to correct their input and resubmit the form.

- **Messages Framework**: Django’s messages framework is used to store and display one-time messages to users. It helps in providing feedback such as success or error messages after form submissions.

#### HTML5 Validation

- **Required Fields**: The contact form uses HTML5 attributes like `required` to ensure that users fill out all necessary fields. This client-side validation helps prevent form submission if required fields are empty.

    ```html
    <form method="post" action="{% url 'contact' %}">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="name">Name</label>
            <input type="text" id="name" name="name" class="form-control" required>
        </div>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="email">Email</label>
            <input type="email" id="email" name="email" class="form-control" required>
        </div>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="subject">Subject</label>
            <input type="text" id="subject" name="subject" class="form-control" required>
        </div>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="message">Message</label>
            <textarea id="message" name="message" class="form-control" rows="5" required></textarea>
        </div>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Send</button>
    </form>
    ```

- **Validation Feedback**: HTML5 provides instant feedback on invalid fields. For example, if a user tries to submit the form with an invalid email address or missing required fields, the browser will display a default error message.

This section provides a comprehensive view of how the contact form operates, from user interaction to server-side processing.
